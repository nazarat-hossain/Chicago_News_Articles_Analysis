Chicago News Articles Analysis to Identify the Key Reasons for Declining Population

Background and Goal of Analysis: Illinois is one of the main state and business hub in the USA. Big cities, attractive towns, growing economy, good school, lower living cost, great lake, farmland, and rivers are the highlights and attractions of the state for living.
However, Illinois is famous for being one of the very few states in the country with negative population growth. In the past decade, it lost more than 850,000 residents to other states, causing the state’s population to shrink for six consecutive years.  Therefore, it has become an immediate necessity to halt the migration of people.
The goal of analysis is to identify the key reasons by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text and provide actionable recommendations on what can be done to reverse this declining population trend.
